Secure Network Design Assignment


1.	Photo 1
a.	The employee laptop and guest computer connecting via the wireless access point might be susceptible to eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, or unauthorized access if the wireless network is not properly secured.
i.	I would implement strong encryption and authentication methods for the wireless network.
b.	The XP-SP1 computer, presumably running Windows XP Service Pack 1, may be especially vulnerable to exploits and attacks due to its outdated and unsupported operating system.
i.	I would update or replace the XP-SP1 computer with a more recent and supported operating system.

2.	Photo 2 
a.	The security issue I see is the interconnectivity between these private area networks could lead to the spread of threats or breaches if one of the networks is compromised.
i.	To mitigate I would use network segmentation to isolate the different private networks from each other, reducing the risk of threats spreading between them.
b.	Misconfiguration of access control rules in the Guard 1 and 2 boxes may expose the private networks to unnecessary risks.
i.	I would implement and maintain strict access control rules to minimize the exposure of private networks to external threats.

3.	Photo 3
a.	A security concern in this photo would be that the PC & Mobile devices are connected to a secure router and can be exposed to malware or unauthorized access.
i.	I would recommend strong and unique passwords for all devices and include 2FA when possible.
b.	The smart plug, webcam, and IP phone connected to the IoT router could be compromised by cybercriminals if they have weak security features or are not updated regularly.
i.	I would ensure the IoT devices with built-in security features, such as strong encryption and secure authentication methods. Update firmware regularly.
